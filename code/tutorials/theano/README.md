## Theano examples in Python 3

This tutorial is heavily based on the [Colin Raffel](https://github.com/craffel/theano-tutorial/blob/master/Theano%20Tutorial.ipynb) and the [Alec Radford](https://github.com/Newmu/Theano-Tutorials) Theano tutorials. These files are slightly modified to run the examples in Theano using Python 3.

### How to install Theano for Python 3 on Ubuntu or Debian

Follow the [Python 3 for scientific computing installation script](https://github.com/milq/installation-scripts).

### How to run the examples:

Simply use ```python3``` and the name of the file. For example: ```python3 00\ -\ Basics.py```.
